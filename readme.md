hyde-h5bp
============
I've put HTML5Boilerplate in a hyde project with
some basic configuration and added a small build
script so you can use HTML5Boilerplate for post-processing
instead of Hyde plugins.

Use
----
Edit files in the `hyde` directory, then run `build.sh`
to run the ant build script and publish them to the
`publish` directory.
